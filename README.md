# Magnet Madness

This project is a android and desktop deployable app. The app is a simple game that puts you 
as a magnet of your choice where you must tap the screen to avoid obstacles. You can grab coins
along the way and powerups to boost your score. You must grab a magnet powerup to keep your magnet
polarized so it doesn't fall.
